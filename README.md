# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithms &amp; Matlab
## Abstract
The genetic algorithms (GAs) are evolutionary algorithms, inspired by the biology,
used often to solve problems classified as NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, like
the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which the challenge is to find a Hamiltonian cycle
linking ùëú points while minimizing the target. The GAs do not provide an exact solution but they
allow finding a solution very close to the optimum in a reasonable time. In this work, we will
try to adapt the traditional principle of genetic algorithms (selection, crossover, mutation ...)
and apply it to the mentioned problem in order to find good solutions for different benchmark
instances from the TSPLIB library. To further improve the results obtained, we will introduce
a new approach inspired also by nature, which is that of immigration. It is an approach which
ensures a great diversity in the population and which will, therefore, obtaining satisfactory
results.
